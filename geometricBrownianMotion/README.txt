This program is an adaption of a monte carlo simulation (adding drift as a component), and will run a simulation for future possible security prices and analyze the results. In the analysis, it lays out a normal distribution of option strikes to sell at, as well as the current respective values of those options. You must change the ticker to change the security for which the test is run on, as well as the strike date, and the number of runs. Strike dates can be found using another program in PyFinance-Projects/getOptionDates/ called "getOptionDates.py". Run that to display all current strike dates, and input the desired strike into this program. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
