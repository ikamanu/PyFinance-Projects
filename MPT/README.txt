This program finds the annualized return and volatility for each security within a pool of securities, and sorts from best to worst based on a return-to-volatility ratio. It then excludes securities which have a ratio that is less than SPY, and a market cap greater than a specific amount. Once finished, it takes the top securities and inputs them into an efficient portfoilio frontier to create an optimized portfolio. By default, the test will run on every ticker within the S&P500. You must change the tickers, portfoilio size, number of securities in the portfoilio, as well as the starting date for the data. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
