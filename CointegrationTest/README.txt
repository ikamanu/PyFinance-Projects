This program finds all cointegrated pairs within a pool of securities, for possible use in pairs trades. Typically, cointergrated pairs tend to be found from similar sub-catergories, such as bond futures and metal futures. At a later date, I will also add a kalman filter backtest to run on all sufficiently cointegrated pairs, and then sort by sharpe ratios/total returns. You must change the tickers to change the securities for which the test is run on. (Use my installs in PyFinance-Projects/extras/ under "installs.txt" if you need to update or install any libraries)
